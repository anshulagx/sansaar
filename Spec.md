## Questions That Need Answering

- [ ]  Currently the system doesn't support sign up like Saral. It's a closed platform. A user needs to be created from the admin panel. What to do in other cases?
- [x]  How can a student be enrolled in multiple pathways?
- [x]  What to do when a student gets converted into a team member? How to deal with the distinction?

## Glossary

### Users
Users of different NG products. A user can either be a team member or a student. Some users can be both. Currently there are different backends for NG products.

### Pathways
Students might be enrolled in a single or multiple pathways. Example: Intro to Canva (Remote) & NavGurukul Residential Prorgram. Every pathway will have its own mentor tree. Every pathway will have a frequency on which the progress tracking for it will take place. Example: Intro to Canva might have weekly progress tracking every Wednesday & NavGurukul Residential Program might have fortnightly progress tracking on every 10th day of the fortnight.

## API Endpoints

### Users

`isTeam` flag will take care if the user is a team member or not. We will need to add a check that academic pathways can only be assigned to a user if they have a student object associated with them. Like if `isTeam` is marked as `False` then certain student level details about a user would need to be given.

1. ~~POST **/users/auth/google**~~
2. ~~GET **/users**~~
3. ~~GET **/users/{userId}**~~
4. ~~GET **/users/me**~~

### Academic Pathways

1. ~~POST **/pathway**~~
2. ~~GET **/pathway**~~
3. ~~GET **/pathway/{pathwayId}**~~ (Return Courses for this Particular Pathway) (Anyone) #Saquib
4. ~~PUT **/pathway/{pathwayId}**~~ (Update Courses for this Particular Pathway) (Admin Only) #Saquib

### Pathway Milestones

1. ~~GET **/pathway/{pathwayId>/milestones**~~
2. ~~POST **/pathway/{pathwayId}/milestones**~~
3. ~~GET **/pathway/{pathwayId}/milestones/{milestoneId}**~~
4. ~~PUT **/pathway/{pathwayId}/milestones/{milestoneId}**~~

### Mentorship

Mentor trees don't exist at a global level. Every academic pathway can have a mentorship tree in itself. Mentorship trees of two pathway (example: Intro to Design and Intro to Code) can have identical mentorship trees but they will be different objects within the DB.

1. ~PUT **/pathway/{pathwayId}/mentorship/users/{userId}/mentees** (Will overwrite the list of mentees under this mentor always)~
2. ~GET **/pathway/{pathwayId}/mentorship/tree** (Will return the complete mentorship tree under the academic pathway)~

### Progress Parameters

1. ~~POST **/progressTracking/parameters**~~
2. ~~GET **/progressTracking/parameters**~~
3. ~~GET **/progressTracking/parameters/{parameterId}**~~
4. ~~PUT **/progressTracking/pramaters/{parameterId}**~~

### Progress Questions

1. ~~POST **/progressTracking/questions**~~
2. ~~GET **/progressTracking/questions**~~
3. ~~GET **/progressTracking/questions/{questionId}**~~

### Progress Tracking Form Structure
1. GET **/pathway/{pathwayId}/trackingForm**
2. PUT **/pathway/{pathwayId}/trackingForm/questions**
3. PUT **/pathway/{pathwayId}/trackingForm/parameters**

### Progress Tracking Requests
1. GET **/progressTracking/users/{userId}/trackingRequests/toAnswer** (Returns a list of all progress tracking requests)
2. POST **/progressTracking/users/{userId}/trackingRequests/{requestId}** (Complete a progress tracking request.)

## Milestone Tracking

Every course can have multiple categories as well.

Each Pathway should have a *sequence of courses* attributed to them.

E.g. Code Stars : let's stay there are 14 courses across different categories that needs to be learnt.
